    "3. Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally mwithin weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.\n",
    "4. Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them.\n",
