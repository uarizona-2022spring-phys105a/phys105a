There will be no quiz nor exam.

The assignment will be assigned approximately once a week.
Students are expected to start working on their assignments during the
hands-on sessions, and finish them by midnight before the day of the
next sessions.

Students are expected to carry out the projects in groups of two or
three people.
Students will have two weeks to finish their projects (see below).

### Writing Requirement

Although this is not a writing intensive course, good documentation is
essential in communicating science and developing software.
Students are required to provide enough written explanations in their
assignments.

### Final Examination or Project

There will be no final exam.

The project deadlines are 11:59pm May 2nd for Session 1 and 11:59pm
April 27th for Session 2.
The two sessions will coordinate a single time slot to present their
projects.
The
[final exam schedule](https://registrar.arizona.edu/faculty-staff-resources/room-course-scheduling/schedule-classes/final-exams/final-exams-spring-2022)
will be helpful in selecting such a time.


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Grading Scale and Policies

There are 8 assignments and 2 projects in total.
Each assignment worth 10 points and each project worth 20 points.

This course provides regular letter grades (A–E), which are based on a
simple point system:

* A: 80–100  points
* B: 70–79.9 points
* C: 60–69.9 points
* D: 50–59.9 points
* E:  0–49.9 points

No scaling will be applied.
Nevertheless, the points for a student's worst 20 points worth of
assignments or project will not be counted.

**Incomplete (I) or Withdrawal (W):**
Incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) grades must be made in accordance
with University policies, which are available at
[here](http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#incomplete)
and
[here](http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#Withdrawal),
respectively.

**Dispute of Grade Policy:**
If a student disagrees on his or her grade on an assignment or
project, the student must send the instructor a formal request through
email to re-evaluate the grade within a week from the time that the
student receives the grade.
Because no scale will be applied in the final grade, the final grade
cannot be re-evaluated.
The student is expected to know of his or her own performance through
out the course.
