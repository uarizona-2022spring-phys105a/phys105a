    "* solve these problems by writing programs in the `python` and `C` programming languages;\n",
    "* speak and write about scientific knowledge;\n",
    "* appreciate computation complexity and have a basic awareness of numerical errors;\n",
    "* use data analysis and numerical methods properly, and be aware of their common pitfalls;\n",
    "* critically analyze and interpret data and results presented in tables, graphs and charts as well as perform appropriate computations;\n",
    "* read and understand scientific literature from popular sources such as magazines and newspapers;\n",
    "* aware of a wide range of science use cases, and develop the skill to self-learn computation tools and methods."
